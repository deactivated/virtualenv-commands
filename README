Virtualenv Commands
-------------------

Virtualenv is a very useful tool that can create isolated Python
environments.  This package provides and extended API and additional
commands for inspecting and manipulating virtualenv environments.

Another project called virtualenvwrapper also provides additional
commands for interacting with virtual environments by creating
shell-level functions.  In contrast, this project is a python-centric
command framework.

These utilities are provided:

      ve -- a wrapper command used to execute ve-* commands
      ve-init -- create and environment by invoking virtualenv
      ve-extend -- chain virtualenvs together
      ve-clone -- create a new virtualenv by copying an existing one

The ``ve`` command will execute any ``ve-*`` program found in the
current path as a subcommand (like git).  This paradigm enforces
consistent semantics and allows additional commands to be easily
written by anyone.  For example, ``ve-init foo`` and ``ve init foo``
are equivalent commands.
